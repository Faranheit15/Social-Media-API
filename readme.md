# Social Media API

This is a simple FastAPI application that demonstrates how to create API endpoints for basic CRUD operations. The application includes routes for retrieving and creating posts.

## Features

- **GET `/`**: Returns a success message indicating that the API is working.
- **GET `/posts`**: Retrieves a list of sample posts.
- **POST `/posts`**: Allows users to create a new post by sending a JSON payload.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Faranheit15/Social-Media-API.git
cd Social-Media-API
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/activate  # MacOS
.venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages using pip.

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To start the FastAPI application, follow these steps:

Activate the Virtual Environment:

Make sure your virtual environment is activated. If it's not already active, you can activate it using:

```bash
.venv/bin/activate  # MacOS
.venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
```

Run the FastAPI Server:

Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI server with the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
The --reload flag automatically reloads the server whenever code changes are detected, making development easier.

### Accessing the API:

Open your web browser or a tool like Postman to test the API.
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to access the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI (Swagger UI).
Testing the Endpoints
Health Check:
To ensure the API is running, send a GET request to the root endpoint:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Fetch Posts:
Retrieve the list of sample posts by sending a GET request to the /posts endpoint:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts
```

Create a Post:
To create a new post, send a POST request with the necessary data to the /posts endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "New Post", "content": "This is the content of the new post", "published": true, "rating": 5}'
```

You can also use tools like Postman to interact with these endpoints more easily.
